                <h1>ABOUT THE SCHOOL.</h1>
                <P>Tepa Senior High School started in 1965 as a Teacher Training College established by the first President of Ghana, Dr. Nkrumah as means of training more teachers for the then educational drive. Six years later, the training college was transmogrified into a second cycle institution to train students to acquire the necessary academic standard for higher education, during the Prime Minister Kofi Abrefa Busia’s era. With the inception of the secondary school in 1971, the first batch of students admitted into form one were sixty boys and twenty girls with Mr. W. G. Forson acting as the headmaster for a short while before Mr. J. A. Gyimah took over as the substantive headmaster. The school actually started from some District Council workshop structures in Tepa Township, but through the efforts of Mr. J. A. Gyimah, and the then Omanhene of Tepa Traditional Council, Nana Kwame Awuah, a total of 103 acres of land was allocated for development. The relocation of the school started gradually from then and in November 2009, the whole school was finally moved to the present site with the school administration being the last with the help of GETFund and the influence of the present Omanhene, Nana Adusei Atwenewah Ampem I and the then headmaster, Mr. Emmanuel Donkor-Bagyinah. It is a public Day and Boarding Second Cycle Institution for both boys and girls. The school indisputably is the pride of Ahafo Ano being the premier second cycle institution in the area</P>
